# Audi car price prediction Machine Learning Phase 1 
## The Problem statement

Roughly 40 million used vehicles are sold globally each year, according to Edmunds.com. For an individual looking to buy or sell a used car, keeping track of the detailed information on what sells and for how much can be quite a daunting task. A survey found that nearly three-quarters of UK car buyers struggle to gauge a used carâ€™s value

The main factors affecting a used vehicle's price are mileage and conditions like transmission, the engine size, the vehicle model, the year the vehicle was made.
 
## Project Overview
In this project, i built a linear regression model that predicts the value of used Audi cars in the UK from Scratch. A linear regression model describes the relationship between a dependent variable, y, and one or more independent variables, X. The dependent variable is also called the response variable. Independent variables are also called explanatory or predictor variables. 

For this project, i took variables like transmission, mileage, age of vehicle, the fuel type, the miles per gallon of vehicle as my predictor variables and the price as my response variable. I used a Linear regression model to describe the relationship between these predictor variables and the response variable. 

I created my algorithm using Python and Pandas and linear regression model from scikit learn
